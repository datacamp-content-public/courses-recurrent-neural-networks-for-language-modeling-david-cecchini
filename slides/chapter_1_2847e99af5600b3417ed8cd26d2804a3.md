## What is keras?

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "a6fc7ee15f"
```

`@part1`
Keras is a high-level API that can use Tensorflow, CNTK and Theano as background deep learning frameworks. 

Thus, in order to use keras, one of those frameworks should be installed (Tensorflow is used by default).


`@part2`
Easy to install and use: 

```
pip install keras
```

```
from keras,models import Model
from keras.layers import LSTM
```

## Main keras modules

```yaml

key: "9fafe9f8fe"
```

`@part1`
**keras.models** contains the classes used to create and manage models: 
1. **Sequential** creates a feed-forward model ()
2. **Model** creates a generic model
